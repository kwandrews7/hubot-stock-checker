Get quick stats on any stock by asking your hubot!

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/hubot-stock-checker.png?downloads=true&&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/hubot-stock-checker/)

This integration utilizes hubot to interact with stock stats provided for free by [IEX Trading](https://iextrading.com/developer). Some friends and I wanted to be able to quickly ask our bot in slack for stock updates and realized that the several existing hubot-scripts were old and broken, many relying on the deprecated Yahoo! Finance APIs. Many thanks to IEX Trading for providing a reliable, free, and easy to use API. It made this entire process way to easy. Hats off to you.

If you have a use case that you would like implemented reach out to me via twitter (@kwandrews7) or get your hands dirty and create a pull request. I'd like to keep this package focused on the IEX API just for consistency, but the APIs available are quite extensive and can do much more than I have currently integrated. Check out their API docs linked above to see what all is available. As I have time, and as they are useful to me :), I will continue integrating with more of their available endpoints.

Example Interaction:

> User >> hubot stock f
> 
> Hubot >> â–¼ Ford Motor Company (F) | Price: $10.05  (-0.298%%) | Day: $10.04  - $10.10  | Year: $9.82  - $13.48  | Market Cap: $40.06 b

## Release Notes

### 1.3.1

* It has been brought to my attention that moving the price field from `latestPrice` to `iexRealtimePrice` was a bad idea. Apparently, the real time price drops to zero after hours for certain stocks. I put it back to latestPrice, my bad.
