This integration utilizes hubot to interact with stock stats provided for free by [IEX](https://iextrading.com/developer). I wanted to be able to quickly ask my bot for stock updates and realized after a quick search that several existing hubot-scripts were old and broken, most relying on the Yahoo! Finance APIs that have long since been shutdown. Many thanks to IEX for providing a reliable, free, and easy to use API. It made this entire process way to easy. Hats off to you folks.

If you have a use case that you would like implemented feel free to do the work yourself and create a pull request or reach out to me via the issues or twitter (@kwandrews7). I'd like to keep this package focused on the IEX API just for consistency, but the APIs available are quite extensive and can do much more than this initial build. Check out their API docs linked above to see what all is available.

Example Interaction:

> User >> hubot stock f
> 
> Hubot >> â–¼ Ford Motor Company (F) | Price: $10.05  (-0.298%%) | Day: $10.04  - $10.10  | Year: $9.82  - $13.48  | Market Cap: $40.06 b

API
---

* `hubot get stock (symbol)` - Returns basic stock stats. 'get' is optional.
