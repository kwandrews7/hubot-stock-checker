Get quick stats on any stock by asking your hubot!

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/hubot-stock-checker.png?downloads=true&&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/hubot-stock-checker/)

This integration utilizes hubot to interact with stock stats provided for free by [IEX Trading](https://iextrading.com/developer). I wanted quick access via my bot to stock updates and realized that the existing hubot options were old and broken; most relying on the deprecated Yahoo! Finance APIs. Many thanks to IEX Trading for providing a reliable, free, and easy to use API. It made this process super easy. 

Since the start of this script, I've been adding features at a pretty good clip to fulfill the of those in our Slack team. However, if you have a feature you want, catch me on twitter (@kwandrews7) or create a pull request. Their API docs are linked above, check it out to see  everything available. 

Example Interaction:

> User >> hubot stock f
> 
> Hubot >> â–¼ Ford Motor Company (F) | Price: $10.05  (-0.298%%) | Day: $10.04  - $10.10  | Year: $9.82  - $13.48  | Market Cap: $40.06 b
