Get quick stats on any stock by asking your hubot!

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/hubot-stock-checker.png?downloads=true&&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/hubot-stock-checker/)

This integration utilizes hubot to interact with stock stats provided by [IEX Cloud](https://iexcloud.io/). I wanted quick access via my bot to stock values and found many existing hubot options were broken. So, I chose to write my own interacting with the free IEX Trading API. As of v2, IEX has moved away from the original IEX Trading api's to a new IEX Cloud api. You will need an IEX Cloud token (api key) to utilize this hubot plugin. Please note that these tokens are free, but paid tiers based on usage do exists. 

Since the start of this script, I've added a handful of features to fulfill the needs of me and my friends. However, if you have a feature you want, catch me on twitter (@kwandrews7) or create a pull request. [API docs are linked are available here.](https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/) 

Example Interaction:

> User >> hubot stock f
> 
> Hubot >> â–¼ Ford Motor Company (F) | Price: $10.05  (-0.298%%) | Day: $10.04  - $10.10  | Year: $9.82  - $13.48  | Market Cap: $40.06 b

## Release Notes

* Readme updated with latest links and information related to IEX Cloud.
* All urls moved into urlBuilder.js to consolidate the use of the token param.

### 1.6.4

* Problem found with non-slack adapters. I was dumbly using the _channel_id field on the message in some places instead of the room field. Other places used the room field correctly, now everything uses the room field. Saving shares and favorites should now work across all adapters. Sorry for the bug.

### 1.6.3

* Deleting saved holdings was broken using an incorrect regex match. This is now fixed.

### 1.6.1

* Added stock symbol and share count to `list my holdings` command.
* Updated `list my holdings` command to allow for an optional trailing space to prevent missed commands typed using mobile keyboards that auto space words.
